I did not consult with my classmates on this assignment, but I attended TA hours on Tuesday. Because I had some previous experience with Java, I am much more familiar with Java than Python. 

The main difference between Java and Python when writing code is the syntax. Java is more “wordy” and less straightforward compared with Python. For example, Java requires System.out.println(); while Python only requires print(). Another difference is that Java uses a compiler, and Python is interpreted, which also means that Java is faster than Python. Some similarities are that both allow OOP and both are widely used.  

The code was able to compile successfully. It displays the right amount of rounds and can printout the conversation transcript at the end. I wasn’t able to have it change the punctuation in the response. Random also did not work in my code. It is able to print out canned responses, but cannot randomize them. I would recommend other students to watch Youtube videos on Java Syntax if they are not familiar with Java, and they should start this assignment early so they have time to get help.
